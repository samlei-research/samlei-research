ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam

I am working on projects regarding hardware acceleration, hardware-optimized programming and efficient software.
The main focus is autonomous systems and robotics, where I try to improve the efficiency both on computational and functional side
of scene understanding and motion planning.

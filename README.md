ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam

I am working on projects regarding hardware acceleration, hardware-optimized programming and efficient software.
The main focus is autonomous systems and robotics, where I try to improve the efficiency both on computational and functional side
of scene understanding and motion planning.

# Projects
## THAMP: THAccelerated Motion Planner

This project developed as part of the [Driverless Mobility](https://github.com/DriverlessMobility) research group at Technical Univeristy of Applied Sciences Augsburg.

### Results

#### Straight Driving

#### Parking Vehicle

#### Overtaking

#### Avoidance

## Yolov4 Edge Object Detection: Jetson TX2 vs. Utlrascale MPSoC

Metrics are: FPS, W. On Jetson TX2 `jtop` was used to measure power consumption, on Ultrascale MPSoC `sysmon`was used.

### Evaluation Hardware

### Latency

| FPS    | Jetson TX2 | UltraZed
| -------- | ------- | -------
| Min  | 3.1 | 3.091
| Max | 3.4 | 3.202
| Avg    | 3.3 | 3.134

### Inference

| Power consumption [W]    | Jetson TX2 | UltraZed
| -------- | ------- | -------
| Inference Off  | 2.216 | 1.734
| Inference On | 9.955 | 2.641 
| Diff.    | 7.739 | 0.906
